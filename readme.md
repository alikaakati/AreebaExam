Integration for the system is done<br/>
I was not able to execute a payment and check the last orderID due to not having a valid credit card at the moment<br/>
I was able to fully understand how the API integration works at areeba<br/>
Pre-requisite :<br/>
XAMP OR WAMP to be installed + launched<br/>
Import db.sql to phpmyadmin<br/>

You need to enable CORS allow origin on the browser before testing<br/>
Importing the db.sql file to your phpmyadmin<br/>
Thank you for your time and consideration !<br/>
